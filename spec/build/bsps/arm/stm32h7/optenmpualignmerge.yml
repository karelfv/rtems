description: |
  Enable the alignment of the size of the combined start, text and
  the rodata section to meet MPU region alignment requirements. This increases
  the memory footprint. It enables a write-protection of the start, text, and
  rodata sections and it also makes those sections executable.
  The option is mutually exclusive with STM32H7_ENABLE_MPU_ALIGNMENT option.
