  Mark this BSP as a secondary boot BSP. This means that BSP will block its boot
  and will wait for notification from the primary boot BSP. The secondary boot
  BSP neither initializes hardware as this is a task of primary boot BSP.
  Recommended practice is to put primary BSP on CM7 and secondary BSP on CM4.
